TCP/IP Suite

The TCP/IP Model and Protocols

The TCP/IP suite defines how data is transmitted across networks, including the internet.


---

1. The Four-Layer TCP/IP Model

Layer	Function

Application	User services (HTTP, FTP, DNS)
Transport	End-to-end communication
Internet	Logical addressing and routing
Network Access	Physical data transmission



---

2. Encapsulation and Decapsulation

Encapsulation: Data is wrapped with headers as it moves down the layers.

Decapsulation: Headers are removed as data moves up the layers at the destination.


This process ensures accurate data delivery.

3. Common TCP/IP Protocols

TCP – Reliable, connection-oriented

UDP – Fast, connectionless

ICMP – Error reporting and diagnostics

ARP – Resolves IP to MAC addresses

DHCP – Automatically assigns IP addresses

DNS – Resolves domain names to IP addresses

4. TCP vs UDP Comparison

Feature	TCP	UDP

Reliability	High	Low
Speed	Slower	Faster
Connection	Required	Not required
Use cases	Web, email	Streaming, gaming

Reflection

The TCP/IP suite governs all modern network communication. Understanding these protocols demonstrates strong foundational knowledge of how data flows across networks.
