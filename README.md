This repository contains my structured networking study notes, created as part of my journey into computer networking and IT systems. The notes combine theory, explanations, and practical insights gained from hands-on labs and simulations using Cisco Packet Tracer.
The goal of this repository is to build a strong networking foundation, starting from core concepts and gradually moving into more advanced networking topics.

📂 Folder Structure

1. IP Addressing
Covers the fundamentals of IPv4 addressing, including:
Binary and decimal representation
Classes of IP addresses
Private vs public IP ranges
Reserved and special-purpose addresses
Basic network identification concepts
This section lays the groundwork for understanding how devices identify and communicate on a network.
2. Subnetting
Focuses on breaking networks into smaller, efficient sub-networks:
Subnet masks and CIDR notation
Network and broadcast addresses
Host calculation techniques
Practical subnetting examples
Subnetting knowledge is essential for network design, optimization, and security.
3. Switching and Routing
Explains how data moves within and between networks:
Switching concepts and VLAN basics
MAC address learning and forwarding
Routing fundamentals
Static and dynamic routing overview
These notes help bridge the gap between theory and real network behavior.
4. TCP/IP
Covers the core protocol suite that powers modern networks:
TCP/IP model layers
IP, TCP, UDP, and ICMP basics
Encapsulation and data flow
Client-server communication concepts
This section explains how data is packaged, transmitted, and received across networks.
🎯 Purpose of This Repository
Reinforce my networking knowledge through clear explanations
Support practical labs and Packet Tracer simulations
Serve as a personal reference and revision guide
Demonstrate consistent learning and discipline in networking
🚀 Learning Approach
These notes are written in simple, beginner-friendly language, with an emphasis on understanding why things work, not just how to configure them.
As my skills grow, this repository will continue to evolve.
