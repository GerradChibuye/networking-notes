1. What is an IP Address?

An IP address (Internet Protocol address) is a unique number assigned to every device on a network so it can identify and communicate with other devices.
IPv4: 32-bit address (e.g., 192.168.1.1)
IPv6: 128-bit address (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3::8a2e:0370:7334)

Why it matters:
Without IP addresses, devices couldn’t send or receive information on a network.
2. Structure of an IPv4 Address
Network portion: Identifies the network the device belongs to
Host portion: Identifies the specific device in that network

Example: 192.168.10.5/24
/24 is the subnet mask, showing the first 24 bits are the network portion.
192.168.10 → Network, 5 → Host

3. Types of IP Addresses

Public IP: Used to identify devices on the internet

Private IP: Used within a local network

Static IP: Permanently assigned

Dynamic IP: Assigned automatically by DHCP

4. Reflection
IP addressing is the foundation of networking.
Understanding how devices are identified ensures we can design, troubleshoot, and maintain networks effectively.
